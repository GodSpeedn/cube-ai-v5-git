# Critical Debug Logging Added

## ‚úÖ Changes Made

I've added **print statements** (not just logging) to ensure they show up in the console output.

### 1. Upload Endpoint (`online_agent_service.py` lines 1105-1120)

```python
print("=" * 80)
print("[DEBUG] Upload endpoint called!")
print(f"[DEBUG] Request data: {request}")
print("=" * 80)

conversation_id = request.get("conversation_id")
print(f"[DEBUG] Extracted conversation_id: {conversation_id}")
```

### 2. File Manager (`file_manager.py` lines 930-941)

```python
print("=" * 80)
print("[FILE_MANAGER] upload_project_to_github called")
print(f"[DEBUG] Active projects keys: {list(self.active_projects.keys())}")
print(f"[DEBUG] Requested conversation_id: {conversation_id}")
print("=" * 80)

if conversation_id not in self.active_projects:
    print(f"[ERROR] conversation_id '{conversation_id}' NOT FOUND in active_projects!")
    print(f"[ERROR] Available keys: {list(self.active_projects.keys())}")
```

## üéØ What You'll See Now

When you run the workflow again and click "Upload to GitHub", you will see:

```
================================================================================
[DEBUG] Upload endpoint called!
[DEBUG] Request data: {'conversation_id': 'manual_workflow_abc123'}
================================================================================
[DEBUG] Extracted conversation_id: manual_workflow_abc123
[DEBUG] Calling file_manager.upload_project_to_github(manual_workflow_abc123)
================================================================================
[FILE_MANAGER] upload_project_to_github called
[DEBUG] Active projects keys: ['manual_workflow_abc123', 'another_project_xyz']
[DEBUG] Requested conversation_id: manual_workflow_abc123
================================================================================
```

OR if the project isn't found:

```
[ERROR] conversation_id 'manual_workflow_abc123' NOT FOUND in active_projects!
[ERROR] Available keys: []
```

## üîç What This Will Tell Us

1. **Is the endpoint being called?** - We'll see `[DEBUG] Upload endpoint called!`
2. **What conversation_id is being sent?** - We'll see the exact value
3. **What projects are available?** - We'll see all keys in `active_projects`
4. **Is there a mismatch?** - We can compare the requested ID with available IDs

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Restart the online agent service** (the changes are in memory)
2. **Run a new workflow** to generate code
3. **Click "Upload to GitHub"** in the modal
4. **Copy and paste ALL the output** from the console (especially the debug lines)
5. **Send me the output** so I can see exactly what's happening

This will finally reveal the root cause of the 404 error!
