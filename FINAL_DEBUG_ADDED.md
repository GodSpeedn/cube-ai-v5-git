# Final Debug Logging - GitHub Service

## ‚úÖ Critical Debug Added

I've added debug logging to the GitHub service to trace the exact API calls:

### In `push_files` method (lines 185-197):
- Shows the repo_name being used
- Shows number of files to push
- Shows when `get_repository` is called
- Shows if `get_repository` succeeds or fails

### In `get_repository` method (lines 147-150):
- Shows the exact URL being called
- Shows the HTTP status code returned

## üéØ What This Will Reveal

When you restart and test again, you'll see output like:

```
[GITHUB_SERVICE] push_files called with repo_name: ai-generated-code-from-coder-a-project-f2345e16
[GITHUB_SERVICE] Number of files: 3
[GITHUB_SERVICE] Getting repository info for: ai-generated-code-from-coder-a-project-f2345e16
[GITHUB_SERVICE] get_repository URL: https://api.github.com/repos/GodSpeedn/ai-generated-code-from-coder-a-project-f2345e16
[GITHUB_SERVICE] get_repository status: 404
[GITHUB_SERVICE] get_repository failed: Repository not found: 404
```

OR if successful:

```
[GITHUB_SERVICE] get_repository status: 200
```

## üîç Expected Issue

I suspect we'll see:
1. Repository created successfully with name `ai-generated-code-from-coder-a-project-f2345e16`
2. 2-second delay happens
3. `push_files` called with correct name
4. `get_repository` returns 404 - **repository doesn't exist yet!**

This means the 2-second delay isn't enough for GitHub to fully initialize the repository with `auto_init=True`.

## üöÄ Possible Solutions

If the debug confirms this:
1. **Increase delay** from 2 to 5 seconds
2. **Add retry logic** - retry get_repository a few times with delays
3. **Don't use auto_init** - create repo without README, push all files at once

## Next Step

**Restart service and test again** - the debug output will confirm the exact failure point!
