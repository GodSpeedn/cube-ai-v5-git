# Online Manual Agent Workflow Fixes

## Summary
Fixed critical issues in the online manual agent workflow to properly create test files, support complex multi-file projects, and display agent communication messages correctly.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Tester Agent Prompts (`backend-ai/online_agent_service.py`)

**Location**: Lines 386-407

**What Changed**:
- Added comprehensive testing instructions for tester agents
- Included requirements for edge case testing (zero, negative numbers, large numbers, empty inputs, None values)
- Added instructions for testing both valid and invalid inputs
- Specified that tester should create separate test functions for each function in complex code
- Added example guidance for multi-function code testing
- Instructed testers not to import the code being tested

**Why**: Tester agents were generating incomplete tests and missing edge cases for complex code. The improved prompts ensure comprehensive test coverage.

### 2. Expanded Test Code Detection Patterns (`backend-ai/online_agent_service.py`)

**Location**: Lines 478-508

**What Changed**:
- Expanded test signal detection to include more patterns:
  - Added "TEST COMPLETE" as a completion signal
  - Added `@pytest` and `@unittest` decorator detection
  - Added more test framework patterns
- Expanded test code pattern detection:
  - Added `self.assertEqual` for unittest
  - Added `TestCase` class detection
  - Added `setUp` and `tearDown` method detection
- Added detailed logging for test detection and saving process

**Why**: Test files weren't being detected and saved because the patterns were too narrow. The expanded patterns catch more test code variations.

### 3. Multi-File Test Support (`backend-ai/online_agent_service.py`)

**Location**: Lines 518-601, 746-810

**What Changed**:
- Modified `_save_generated_code()` to support multiple code blocks
- Added new `_extract_multiple_code_blocks()` method to extract multiple ```python code blocks
- Updated file saving to process each code block separately
- Enhanced task descriptions to indicate part numbers (e.g., "Part 1/3")
- Added summary logging for multi-file saves
- Stores total file count in project metadata

**Why**: Complex code often requires multiple test files, but the system only saved the first code block. Now it can save all test files generated by the tester.

### 4. Agent Metadata in Messages (`backend-ai/online_agent_service.py`)

**Location**: Lines 950-964

**What Changed**:
- Added metadata to response messages including:
  - `from_agent_role`: Role of the sending agent
  - `from_agent_name`: Name of the sending agent
  - `from_agent_model`: Model used by the sending agent
  - `to_agent_role`: Role of the receiving agent
  - `to_agent_name`: Name of the receiving agent
- Metadata is now passed to the frontend for better filtering

**Why**: Messages didn't have enough information for the frontend to match them to specific agent connections. The metadata enables accurate message filtering.

### 5. Improved Connection Message Filtering (`offline-ai-frontend/src/components/ManualAgentCanvas.tsx`)

**Location**: Lines 1690-1730

**What Changed**:
- Implemented case-insensitive message matching
- Added partial string matching (e.g., "Coder" matches "Coder Agent")
- Added word-based matching to handle variations like "Coder_Agent" or "coder-agent"
- Improved matching logic to check both role names and box IDs
- Added bidirectional matching (messages in either direction between agents)

**Why**: Connection popup wasn't showing messages because the matching was too strict. The improved logic handles various agent naming patterns.

## How It Works Now

### Test File Creation Flow

1. **User creates online manual workflow** with Coder → Tester → Runner
2. **User submits task** (e.g., "create a calculator with add, subtract, multiply, divide")
3. **Coder agent generates code** and saves it to `backend-ai/generated/[project]/src/`
4. **Tester agent receives code** and follows enhanced prompts:
   - Creates comprehensive test functions
   - Tests each function separately
   - Includes edge cases (zero, negative, None, empty inputs)
   - Generates multiple test functions for complex code
5. **System detects test code** using expanded patterns
6. **System extracts multiple code blocks** if present
7. **Each test block is saved** to `backend-ai/generated/[project]/tests/` with proper naming
8. **System logs detailed information** about saved files

### Connection Message Display Flow

1. **User clicks on a connection** between two agents
2. **Frontend filters messages** using enhanced matching:
   - Normalizes agent names (lowercase, trim)
   - Checks exact matches first
   - Falls back to partial matches
   - Checks word-based matches
3. **Messages are displayed** showing:
   - From agent → To agent
   - Timestamp
   - Message content (truncated to 3 lines)
   - Total message count
4. **If no messages**, shows "No messages yet" placeholder

## Testing

### Test Scenarios

1. **Simple Code with Tests**:
   - Task: "Create a function to add two numbers"
   - Expected: 1 source file, 1 test file
   - Result: ✅ Both files created

2. **Complex Code with Multiple Functions**:
   - Task: "Create a calculator with add, subtract, multiply, divide"
   - Expected: 1 source file, 1 test file with multiple test functions
   - Result: ✅ Test file includes test_add, test_subtract, test_multiply, test_divide

3. **Multi-File Test Project**:
   - Task: "Create a data processor with validator, transformer, and analyzer"
   - Expected: 1 source file, 3 test files (one for each component)
   - Result: ✅ All test files saved separately

4. **Connection Message Display**:
   - Create workflow: Coder → Tester → Runner
   - Click on Coder → Tester connection
   - Expected: Shows messages exchanged between coder and tester
   - Result: ✅ All messages displayed correctly

## File Locations

### Generated Files Structure
```
backend-ai/generated/
└── [project-name]/
    ├── src/
    │   └── [source-files].py
    └── tests/
        └── [test-files].py
```

### Modified Files
- `backend-ai/online_agent_service.py`: Backend logic for test generation and saving
- `offline-ai-frontend/src/components/ManualAgentCanvas.tsx`: Frontend connection message display

## Benefits

1. **Complete Test Coverage**: Tester agents now generate comprehensive tests for complex code
2. **Multi-File Support**: Can handle projects with multiple test files
3. **Better Visibility**: Users can see exact communication between connected agents
4. **Improved Reliability**: Enhanced detection patterns catch more test code variations
5. **Better Organization**: Test files are properly saved to tests/ directory
6. **Enhanced Debugging**: Detailed logging helps track test creation and saving

## Future Improvements

1. **Test Execution**: Add automatic test execution for generated tests
2. **Test Results Display**: Show test pass/fail status in the UI
3. **Test Coverage Metrics**: Display what percentage of code is covered by tests
4. **Custom Test Frameworks**: Support for more test frameworks (doctest, nose2, etc.)
5. **Test Suggestions**: AI-powered suggestions for missing test cases
