# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The health monitoring system currently has critical issues preventing proper functionality. Users are experiencing problems with the health page not displaying correctly and API key validation failing even when correct keys are provided. This feature aims to fix these core issues to ensure the health monitoring system works reliably.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the health page to load and display system status correctly, so that I can monitor the application's health.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the health endpoint THEN the system SHALL return a proper health status response
2. WHEN the health page is accessed THEN the system SHALL display service status, dependency status, and overall system health
3. WHEN there are system issues THEN the health page SHALL clearly show what problems exist and suggested actions
4. IF the health monitoring service is not running THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want API key validation to work correctly when I provide valid keys, so that I can use AI models in the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides a valid API key THEN the system SHALL successfully validate it
2. WHEN API key validation occurs THEN the system SHALL properly test the key against the provider's API
3. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages explaining why
4. WHEN keys are stored THEN the system SHALL persist them correctly for future use
5. IF a key is invalid THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate which provider and what the issue is

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want model discovery to work after providing valid API keys, so that I can see available models from different providers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN valid API keys are provided THEN the system SHALL discover available models from those providers
2. WHEN model discovery runs THEN the system SHALL return a list of models with their capabilities
3. WHEN no models are found THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback about why discovery failed
4. IF API keys are missing THEN the system SHALL indicate which providers need keys

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper error handling and logging throughout the health monitoring system, so that I can troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
2. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide actionable error messages
3. WHEN services are down THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate which services and why
4. IF configuration is missing THEN the system SHALL guide users on how to fix it
