# Additional Debug Logging Added

## ‚úÖ What Was Added

I've added **print statements** throughout the critical path to trace exactly what's happening:

### 1. In `upload_project_to_github` (lines 948-961):
- Shows project directory path
- Shows if project directory exists
- Lists ALL files in project directory
- Shows when `_auto_upload_to_github` is called
- Shows what `_auto_upload_to_github` returns

### 2. In `_auto_upload_to_github` file collection (lines 461-495):
- Shows when file collection starts
- Lists project directory contents
- Shows number of files collected
- Lists each file path collected

## üéØ What You'll See Next

When you restart the service and run the workflow again, you'll see detailed output like:

```
================================================================================
[DEBUG] Upload endpoint called!
[DEBUG] Request data: {'conversation_id': 'manual_workflow_...'}
================================================================================
[DEBUG] Extracted conversation_id: manual_workflow_...
================================================================================
[FILE_MANAGER] upload_project_to_github called
[DEBUG] Active projects keys: ['manual_workflow_...']
[DEBUG] Requested conversation_id: manual_workflow_...
================================================================================
[DEBUG] Project dir: C:\...\generated\projects\calculator_xyz
[DEBUG] Project exists: True
[DEBUG] Files in project dir: ['C:\\...\\src\\calculator.py', 'C:\\...\\tests\\test_calculator.py']
[UPLOAD] Manually uploading project to GitHub: calculator-project
[DEBUG] About to call _auto_upload_to_github...
[DEBUG] Starting file collection from: C:\...\generated\projects\calculator_xyz
[DEBUG] Project dir contents: [WindowsPath('C:\\...\\src'), WindowsPath('C:\\...\\tests')]
[DEBUG] Collected 2 files before README
[DEBUG]   - src/calculator.py
[DEBUG]   - tests/test_calculator.py
```

## üîç What This Will Reveal

This will show us:
1. **Whether the project directory exists**
2. **What files are actually in the directory**
3. **Whether files are being collected properly**
4. **What's being passed to GitHub API**

## üöÄ Next Step

**Restart the online agent service and run another test!**

The comprehensive debug output will pinpoint the exact issue.
